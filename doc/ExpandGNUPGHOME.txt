
ExpandGNUPGHOME v1.0.0.4 by Veit Berwig in 11/2021

This is a quick hack of a tiny helper program for exporting the
"GNUPGHOME" and "GNUPGCAROOT" environment variables into local user
environment with an additional environment-update at runtime in order
to talk to all running local user apps that the environment has
changed.

Details:
"AppData" will be read first from:
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"

"Common AppData" will be read first from:
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"

The resulting value will be written into the corresponding variable
under the Registry in "HKCU\Environment", with broadcasting a message
"WM_SETTINGCHANGE":
https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/winmsg/wm-settingchange

When a "-" is supplied to the ini-file, the the value will be deleted
from the Registry in "HKCU\Environment".

The program was coded by using the AutoIt Script-Engine for
Win x86/x64. I did this because of execution-policy-rules;
a standalone-executable is much better here ...

* The INI-file will only be used if it is in the same directory as
  the executable and will not be written, so you may use it in a
  restricted environment.

* If you use "ExpandGNUPGHOME" without ini-file or with all masked,
  values in ini-file, then APPDATA will be read from the
  "User Shell Folders" registry-key under:
  "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
  Explorer\User Shell Folders"
  GNUPGHOME is build by combining $APPDATA% and "\GnuPG" to
  %APPDATA\GnuPG. If the registry-key cannot be read, the a default
  value of "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\GnuPG" will be used, if
  ini-file or values cannot be evaluated.

* If a "%"-string is found in the value of GNUPGHOME, then
  a REG_EXPAND_SZ value will be created in the registry under
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment.

* If a "-"-string or a  ""-string ist used for GNUPGHOME in the
  ini-file, then GNUPGHOME will be removed from the environment.

* You may rename ExpandGNUPGHOME.exe to another NAME.EXE
  (i.e. Delete_ExpandGNUPGHOME.exe). Here copy ExpandGNUPGHOME.ini
  to Delete_ExpandGNUPGHOME.ini in order to provide a deletion
  of GNUPGHOME by unmasking one of the deletion-lines in
  Delete_ExpandGNUPGHOME.ini and masking the other lines (see below).

Example ExpandGNUPGHOME.ini:
====================================================================
[Main Prefs]
;#################
;# Delete Values #
;#################
;GNUPGHOME=-
;GNUPGCAROOT=-
;
;###########################
;# Create or update Values #
;###########################
GNUPGHOME=%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\GnuPG
GNUPGCAROOT=%ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg\trusted-certs

may the sourcecode be with you ...
